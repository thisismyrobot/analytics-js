# Hit counter example

Experimenting with Google's Analytics API, using their JavaScript client.

Currently it's just an example of making a bell sound everytime there is a
unique hit on a path.

# Setup

You'll need to configure config.js, see the links in there for help.

## Why does the JavaScript look a bit wierd?

I'm having a play with the
[standardjs style guide](http://standardjs.com/rules.html).
