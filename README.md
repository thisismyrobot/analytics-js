# GAH

(Google Analyiccs Hit counter)

Experimenting with Google's Analytics API, using their JavaScript client.

Consider this a worked example of making a bell sound everytime there is a
unique hit on a path.

## Setup

You'll need to configure config.js, see the links in there for help.

Then open test.html.

## Why does the JavaScript look a bit wierd?

I'm having a play with the
[standardjs style guide](http://standardjs.com/rules.html).
